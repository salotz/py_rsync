* Installation

To install from pip (which may be out of date):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  pip install py_rsync[all]
#+END_SRC

There are some optional features you can install as well using the
"extras" spec in pip. Currently, these are:

- all :: installs all extras

Check the setup.py file under ~extras_requirements~ for the full
listing.

You can always install from git as well for the latest:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pip install git+https://github.com/salotz/py_rsync
#+END_SRC


If installation went alright this command should succeed:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  python -c "import py_rsync"
#+END_SRC
